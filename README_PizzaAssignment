Create an application for the BigY Store. The user selects a pizza order from the list, 
and the app displays the price. The customer can select a sandwich size of small ($5), 
medium ($10), large ($15), or super ($20) and one of a variety of toppings. 
There is a $0.50 additional charge for toppings; if the user requests two toppings, the additional cost is $1. 
There is also a deal in which if a user requests three toppings, the additional cost should be $1.25, not $1.50. 
Max toppings is 3 and there is no additional charge for extra cheese. 
Be as creative as you like too.
